//THere are 3 types of functions(Local, Global and static).

//A variable declared outside a function has a GLOBAL SCOPE and can only be accessed outside a function:

<?php
$x = 5; // global scope

function myTest() {
  // using x inside this function will generate an error
  echo "<p>Variable x inside function is: $x</p>";
}
myTest();

echo "<p>Variable x outside function is: $x</p>";
?>
