PHP is an acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor"
Not Case Sensitive Language
In PHP, keywords (e.g. if, else, while, echo, etc.), classes, functions, and user-defined functions are not case-sensitive.
However; all variable names are case-sensitive

In PHP, a variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable:
PHP is a Loosely Typed Language
We donot have to tell PHP which data type the variable is. PHP automatically associates a data type to the variable, depending on its value.

To get the data type of a variable, use the var_dump() function.

PHP has three different variable scopes:
local
global
static

A variable declared outside a function has a GLOBAL SCOPE and can only be accessed outside a function:
A variable declared within a function has a LOCAL SCOPE and can only be accessed within that function:

The global keyword is used to access a global variable from within a function.
To do this, use the global keyword before the variables (inside the function):


//Data Type
PHP supports the following data types:

String
Integer
Float (floating point numbers - also called double)
Boolean
Array
Object
NULL
Resource
You can get the data type of any object by using the var_dump() function.

//String
Strings in PHP are surrounded by either double quotation marks, or single quotation marks.
Double quoted string literals perform operations for special characters
Single quoted strings does not perform such actions, it returns the string like it was written, with the variable name
