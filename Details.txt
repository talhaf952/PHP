PHP is an acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor"
Not Case Sensitive Language
In PHP, keywords (e.g. if, else, while, echo, etc.), classes, functions, and user-defined functions are not case-sensitive.
However; all variable names are case-sensitive

In PHP, a variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable:
PHP is a Loosely Typed Language
We donot have to tell PHP which data type the variable is. PHP automatically associates a data type to the variable, depending on its value.

To get the data type of a variable, use the var_dump() function.

PHP has three different variable scopes:
local
global
static

A variable declared outside a function has a GLOBAL SCOPE and can only be accessed outside a function:
A variable declared within a function has a LOCAL SCOPE and can only be accessed within that function:

The global keyword is used to access a global variable from within a function.
To do this, use the global keyword before the variables (inside the function):


//Data Type
PHP supports the following data types:

String
Integer
Float (floating point numbers - also called double)
Boolean
Array
Object
NULL
Resource
You can get the data type of any object by using the var_dump() function.

//String
Strings in PHP are surrounded by either double quotation marks, or single quotation marks.
Double quoted string literals perform operations for special characters
Single quoted strings does not perform such actions, it returns the string like it was written, with the variable name


The PHP strlen() function returns the length of a string.
echo strlen("Hello world!");

The PHP str_word_count() function counts the number of words in a string.
echo str_word_count("Hello world!");

The PHP strpos() function searches for a specific text within a string.
echo strpos("Hello world!", "world");

The strtoupper() function returns the string in upper case:
$x = "Hello World!";
echo strtoupper($x);

The strtolower() function returns the string in lower case:
$x = "Hello World!";
echo strtolower($x);

The PHP str_replace() function replaces some characters with some other characters in a string.
$x = "Hello World!";
echo str_replace("World", "Dolly", $x);

The PHP strrev() function reverses a string.
$x = "Hello World!";
echo strrev($x);

Remove Whitespace
Whitespace is the space before and/or after the actual text, and very often you want to remove this space.
The trim() removes any whitespace from the beginning or the end:
$x = " Hello World! ";
echo trim($x);

Convert String into Array
The PHP explode() function splits a string into an array.
The first parameter of the explode() function represents the "separator". The "separator" specifies where to split the string.
